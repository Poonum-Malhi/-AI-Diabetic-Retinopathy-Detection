# -AI-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
I took part in this project with my teammates - Dileep Kumar Malhi and Sheela Davi Malhi.  
<br>
Overview: The project aims to develop an AI system for early detection of diabetic retinopathy using retinal images. By analyzing these images, the system will classify cases into different stages of retinopathy.

Objectives: Data: Collect and preprocess diverse retinal images. Model: Train a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) for accurate classification. Classification: Categorize retinopathy severity levels. Interpretability: Provide insights into model decisions. Interface: Create user-friendly app for image uploads and results. Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and performance. Ethics: Ensure privacy, transparency, and medical oversight.

Outcome: The AI Diabetic Retinopathy Detection system will aid medical professionals in timely identification of diabetic retinopathy, potentially preventing blindness among diabetic patients.
